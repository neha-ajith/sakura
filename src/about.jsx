        Hi, you can call me N. A girl in her early twenties, trying to figure
        out the meaning of life and its purpose. She feels like she is barely
        existing, holding on and trying to live each day as it comes. I love to
        occasionally rant on my phone because I realized ranting to people can
        do no good than harm.
        <br /> <br /> This was my brainchild when I wanted my most vulnerable
        side in some corner of the internet. Even if I would be dead someday, I
        will live in this corner of the internet through this small blog. I
        prefer this to be less crowded, but if you're seeing this, thanks for
        stopping by. Hope you have a good time here! :)
        <br /><br />Thanks for bearing with me.
      </p>
